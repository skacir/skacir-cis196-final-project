# skacir-cis196-final-project

See it live at https://triptrap.herokuapps.com 

This project was created as the final project for the Spring 2017 CIS 196 Ruby on Rails course taught by Justin Kim at UPenn. It currently uses only Rails built in gems.

It is designed to be a student transit web app. The ideal use case is a student wants to travel somewhere but a) doesn't have a car or b) doesn't want to go alone. So they put the details of the trip into the web app and anyone can join. Of those who join, the trip creator can choose which is the driver.


* To-do:
  * add messaging portion so drivers can be vetted and/or trip-goers can communicate amongst themselves
  * add groups so trips can be made available only to members of the same group
