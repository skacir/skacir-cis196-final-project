# skacir-cis196-final-project

This project was created as the final project for the Spring 2017 CIS 196 Ruby on Rails course taught by Justin Kim at UPenn. It currently uses only Rails built in gems.

It is designed to be a student transit web app. The ideal use case is a student wants to travel somewhere but a) doesn't have a car or b) doesn't want to go alone. So they put the details of the trip into the web app and anyone can join or volunteer to drive.


* To-do:
  * add driver to trips
  * add messaging portion so drivers can be vetted and/or trip-goers can communicate amongst themselves
  * make a nice UI
